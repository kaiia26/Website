# A Digital Orchard of Knowledge 🌱

A website that gathers inspiration from the design from the ages of the early web, this website provides a bundle of information from various categories that is available right at your fingertips and is supported on 
a multitude of devices.

## Description

This unique website, blending together various elements of web design from the 1990s-2000s, presents a unique outlook of information in an easily and digestible format. This website started as a passion project for me,
and in a way traces back to my childhood roots. Ever since I was younger I used to love reading, whether that was fiction books such as A Wrinkle in Time or nonfiction books such as National Geographic. But what really
drove inspiration for this website was books that contained all kinds of information such as Encyclopedias, Farmers' Almanac, and Guinness World Records. Whether the particular topic resonated with me or not, I deeply enjoyed
the act of uncovering a page and discovering something new, much like unearthing a fossil. There is lots of amazing knowledge out there that is waiting to be discovered, just at our fingertips. Whether the information presents
a use in our daily lives, such as sharing this newfound knowledge with our friends, or is kept close to the heart, the act of uncovering something new and a joy for learning is a feeling I wish to recreate in my website. My
end goal for this website is to provide a user-friendly interface while also retaining the style of the old web at heart.
